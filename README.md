Experiments with front-end development

These are several tiny experiments/projects I did when learning front-end development.
Their folder-names have number prefixes that rank them in the order in which they are my favorite.

To run most projects in this repository, click open the html file inside.
Some will however have their own very small README files.

Enjoy! :)
